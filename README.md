# Face recognition experiments 

1 - basic trainning using jupyter
2 - create pipeline 
3 - fix rotation and add image darkening

future experiments
4 - adapt experiment to use single class and explore results from predict
5 - use pipeline with larger dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
6 - use https://keras.io/keras_tuner/

# images of bubbles processing

1 - find and mark contours - is the opencv good enough to process bubbles? yeap!
2 - experiment options on how to detect contour
